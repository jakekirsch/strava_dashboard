Even as a complete beginner to using API's, once I had the keys it only took a little experimenting to figure out how to use it. I found this [blog post](https://yizeng.me/2017/01/11/get-a-strava-api-access-token-with-write-permission/) by Yi Zeng very helpful to figure out how to get additional read and write permissions that are necessary to request more detailed information. \n",

It is clear there are more sophisticated and robust ways of doing this, but for a quick and easy solution, you can create a `config.py` file in your project folder and use that script to store your keys. Then you add `config.py` to your `.gitignore` and it doesn't get uploaded."
